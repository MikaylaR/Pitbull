    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <p>The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) is a purebred dog breed recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) and
            American Dog Breeders Association (ADBA), but not the American Kennel Club (AKC). It is a medium-sized,
            intelligent, short-haired dog, of a solid build, whose early ancestors came from the British Isles. When
            compared with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffordshire_Bull_Terrier">Staffordshire Bull
                Terrier</a>, the American Pit Bull Terrier is larger by several
            margins.
            The APBT varies in size.
            Males normally are about 18–21 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr> in height and around 35–60 <abbr
                title="pounds">lbs</abbr> in weight. Females
            are normally around 17–20 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr> in height and 30–50 <abbr title="pounds">lbs</abbr>
            in
            weight.
        </p>
        <p>According to the ADBA, the American Pit Bull is prescribed to be medium-sized and has a short coat and smooth
            well-defined muscle structure, and its eyes are to be round to almond-shaped, and its ears are to be small
            to
            medium in length, typically half prick or rose in carriage. The tail is prescribed to be slightly thick and
            tapering to a point. The coat is required by the ADBA to be glossy, smooth, short, and stiff to the touch.
            Many
            colors, color patterns, and combinations of colors are acceptable to the ADBA, except that both the ADBA and
            UKC
            do not recognize merle coloring. Color patterns that are typical in the breed are solid and tuxedo.
        </p>
        <p>Despite the colloquial use of the term "pit bull" to encompass a whole category of dogs and the legal use of
            the
            term to include several breeds in legislation, some conservative professional breeders of the American Pit
            Bull
            Terrier as well as some experts and supporters claim that historically the APBT is the only
            <strong>true</strong> "pit bull" and
            the only breed that should be denominated as such.
