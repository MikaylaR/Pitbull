        <p>Until the mid-19th century the now extinct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_White_Terrier">
                Old
                English Terriers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_Bulldog">Old English
                Bulldogs</a> were
            bred together to
            produce a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the
            bulldog.
            This
            type of dog, which was bred in the British Isles, became known as the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_and_terrier">bull-and-terrier</a>. They arrived in the
            United States in the late nineteenth century where they became the direct ancestors of the American Pit
            Bull
            Terrier.

        <p>In the United Kingdom, Bull-and-terriers were used in bloodsports such as bull baiting and bear baiting.
            These
            bloodsports were officially eliminated in 1835 when Britain introduced animal welfare laws. Since dog
            fightings
            are cheaper to organize and far easier to conceal from the law than bull or bear baits, bloodsport
            proponents
            turned to pitting their dogs against each other instead. Dog fighting was used as both a bloodsport
            (often
            involving gambling) and a way to continue to test the quality of their stock. For decades afterwards,
            dog
            fighting clandestinely took place in small areas of Britain. These dogs arrived in America around 1845
            to
            1860,
            where the dog fighting practice had continuity and a new American dog breed arrived. On February 10,
            1898,
            the
            breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) named as American Pit Bull Terrier.
        </p>
        <p>In the early 20th century, pit bulls were used as catch dogs in America for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to
            hunt
            hogs, and drive livestock, and as family companions. But the dog fighting remained the main use of the
            breed
            until 1976 when it was outlawed in all states.
