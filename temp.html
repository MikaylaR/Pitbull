    <p>The UKC gives this description of the characteristic of the American Pit Bull: "The essential characteristics
        of the American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest for life. This breed is eager to please and
        brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love
        of children. Because most APBTs exhibit some level of [inter]dog aggression and because of its powerful
        physique, the APBT requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. The breed's
        natural agility makes it one of the most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a must for this breed. The
        APBT is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers. Aggressive
        behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. This breed does very well in
        performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work."
    </p>
    <p>American Pit Bull Terriers excel in many dog sports, including weight pulling, dog agility, flyball, lure
        coursing, and advanced obedience competition. Out of the 115 dogs who have earned UKC "superdog" status (by
        gaining championship titles in conformation, obedience, agility, and weightpull), 34 have been American Pit Bull
        Terriers, and another 13 were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Staffordshire_Terrier">American
            Staffordshire Terriers</a>.</p>
    <p>The American Pit Bull Terrier is a working dog, and is suitable for a wide range of working disciplines due to
        their intelligence, high energy, and endurance. In the United States they have been used as search and rescue
        dogs, police dogs performing narcotics and explosives detection, Border Patrol dogs, hearing dogs to provide
        services to the deaf, as well as general service dogs. In the South they are often a favorite dog for catching
        feral pigs.
    </p>
    <p>The APBT breed has a high prey drive due to its being bred to chase and subdue livestock. However, it is not
        naturally aggressive towards people and is affectionate toward children. Depending on early
        socialization and handling, the APBT can learn to restrain itself from unwarranted aggression towards other
        dogs.</p>
