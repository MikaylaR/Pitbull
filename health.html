        <h1>Overall Health</h1>
        <p>Due to their athleticism and diverse breeding background, APBTs tend to be strong and muscular, with good
            skeletal formation. They have an average
            lifespan of 12 to 14 years, longer than many breeds of a similar size. There are some genetic conditions to
            be
            watchful for. The breed is generally healthy, but can have problems with hip dysplasia, cataracts, and heart
            disease. Other health ailments seen in APBTs include thyroid and congenital heart defects.</p>

    <h1>Genetic Predispositions</h1>
    <h3>Hip dysplasia</h3>
    <p>The breed tends to have a higher than average incidence of hip dysplasia. You’ve probably heard of hip dysplasia,
        an inherited disease that causes the hip joints to form improperly and leads to arthritis: it is common in
        American Pitbull Terriers. You may notice lameness in the hind legs or difficulty getting up
        from lying down. Surgery is sometimes considered in severe and life-limiting cases of hip dysplasia. While this
        condition is largely hereditary in these breeds and particularly affects older dogs, keeping your companion at a
        healthy weight will greatly reduce the chances of this condition.
    </p>
    <h3>Mange</h3>
    <p>Demodex is a microscopic mite that lives in the hair follicles of dogs. All dogs have them. Normally the
        immune system keeps the mites in check, but some breeds, like the APBT, develop an overabundance of these
        mites. In mild cases, pet owners may notice a few dry, irritated, hairless lesions. These often occur on the
        face or feet and may or may not be itchy. Secondary skin infections may occur. Prompt veterinary care is
        important to keep the disease from getting out of hand. Many pets seem to outgrow the problem, while others
        require lifelong management.
    </p>
    <h3>Thyroid</h3>
    <p>Hypothyroidism is another illness APBTs are prone to. When the thyroid glands fail to produce enough thyroid
        hormones, the dog will start to gain excessive weight and develop skin diseases. Aside from the physical
        manifestation, hypothyroidism can also induce fearful aggression and other drastic behavioral changes. Thyroid
        diseases are diagnosed through a blood screening test on the vet’s lab. Most cases of hypothyroidism can
        be managed through the administration of synthetic thyroid hormones called thyroxine.</p>
    <h3>Allergies</h3>
    <p>They are very prone to allergies, more so than other breeds. It can range from grass and pollen to
        fleas or ticks. They are also notorious to food allergies, especially to products with wheat or grain
        components. Usually dogs with allergies will lick, scratch, drool, and shed more than usual. Incessant
        scratching can lead to wounds and bleeding. If it’s not treated right away, skin
        infections may ensue.</p>
